# StudentPerformancePredictor


For this project, we will be looking at the data set of student performance (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance). This data set illustrates over thirty attributions for students taking math and Portuguese language course. The data comes from two datasets on Portuguese students and their performance in math (395 observations) and Portuguese (649 observations) courses The data was obtained through school reports and surveys which includes student grades, demographic, social, and school-related parameters.

This project revolves around the performance of Portuguese students from two different schools and their grades related to school performance. The key courses that the students are being graded on are math and the Portuguese language because in the past year’s Portuguese students have been obtaining the lowest grades compared to the rest of Europe. 

* The target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade, while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and the 2nd-period grade.



#Importance

With the information gathered, there can make a clear correlation made to the high failure rates
● There will be a visual description of what causes the students to do poorly and what
aspects of their lives contribute to these outcomes
● Gathering multiple attributes will give a more informative insights on what needs to
change inside and outside of the student school lives
●  Prediction of what attributes correlate to lower grades
